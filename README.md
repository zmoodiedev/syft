## 💡 Why I Built This

As someone who loves cooking, I wanted a better way to save recipes from different sources and share them with friends without having to read someones blog or view a million ads. This project showcases my ability to:
- Build full-stack web applications with modern frameworks
- Integrate third-party services (Firebase) effectively
- Implement social features and user interactions
- Solve real-world problems with custom solutions (web scraping)
- Create clean, maintainable codebases

## 📝 What I Learned

- React best practices and hooks for state management
- Firebase ecosystem (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
- Building and configuring web scrapers for data extraction
- Designing scalable database schemas for social applications
- Managing asynchronous operations and data fetching in React
- Deploying React applications to production
